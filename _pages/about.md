I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Statistics and Probability at <font color="darkblue">Michigan State Uninversity</font>. My research interests lie in the fields of high-dimensional statistics and statistical machine learning. 

Prior to MSU, I was a postdoctoral research associate in the Department of Operations Research and Financial Engineering at <font color="darkblue">Princeton University</font>, advised by Professor Jianqing Fan. In 2017, I completed my Ph.D. in Statistics at <font color="darkblue">Columbia University</font>, advised by Professors Yang Feng and Arian Maleki. Before going to Columbia, I received a B.S. in Statistics from <font color="darkblue">University of Science and Technology of China</font>, where I wrote my undergraduate thesis under the supervision of Professor Yaning Yang.
